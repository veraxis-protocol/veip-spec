# VEIP 0.1.0 – Public Working Draft Status

## Status Classification

VEIP 0.1.0 is designated as a Public Working Draft.

This indicates:

- Core invariants are defined.
- State-transition semantics are stable in structure.
- Evidence Pack schema is operational but may receive field clarifications.
- Conformance semantics may expand prior to 1.0.

## Expected Changes Before 1.0

- Terminology tightening.
- Expanded Conformance Test Suite vectors.
- Clarification of Supervisory Verification Interface semantics.
- Registry interaction refinements.
- Cryptographic binding profile definitions.

## Stability Commitments

The following invariants are considered foundational and unlikely to change:

1. Execution Authorization Precedes Action.
2. Deterministic State-Transition Formalism.
3. Evidence Pack Determinism Requirement.
4. Explicit Supervisory Classification.
5. Conformance Defined by Behavior.

## Implementation Guidance

Early adopters should:

- Declare explicit version targeting.
- Isolate VEIP semantics from business logic.
- Expect minor field adjustments in Evidence Pack schema prior to 1.0.
