# Multi-Operator Registry Model

## Purpose

The VEIP Registry model is designed to prevent concentration risk while preserving certification integrity.

VEIP separates:

- Specification authority
- Conformance validation logic
- Certification issuance
- Operational registry services

This separation allows for multiple authorized registry operators.

## Structural Layers

1. Specification (Open)
2. Verifier Core (Inspectable)
3. Registry Operator (Accredited Entity)

## Multi-Operator Design

The model supports:

- Multiple jurisdictional registry operators
- Cross-recognition agreements
- Shared conformance standards
- Independent audit requirements

Registry operators must:

- Implement the official Conformance Test Suite
- Use approved Verifier Core versions
- Publish attestation transparency reports
- Undergo periodic external audit

## Preventing Centralized Capture

The specification remains open and unencumbered.

No single operator controls:

- Implementation rights
- Specification changes
- Conformance definition

Certification authority may be delegated to:

- Independent institutions
- Industry consortia
- Regulatory sandboxes
- National supervisory bodies

## Interoperability

Registry operators must:

- Maintain public certificate lookup APIs
- Anchor attestations to shared transparency logs
- Support cross-border recognition protocols

## Failover & Continuity

If a registry operator ceases operation:

- Certification records remain valid.
- Alternative operators may assume recognition responsibilities.
- Specification stewardship remains independent.

## Supervisory Assurance

Regulators may:

- Audit registry operators.
- Review conformance validation logs.
- Participate as non-voting observers in governance.

This federated model ensures:

- Open implementation rights.
- Controlled certification semantics.
- Reduced systemic concentration risk.
- Preservation of supervisory trust.
