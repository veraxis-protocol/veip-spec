# Regulatory Positioning Summary

VEIP is structured to reduce supervisory concentration risk while preserving execution integrity.

The specification layer (veip-spec) is irrevocably open and may be implemented by any institution without restriction. This ensures that no single vendor controls the definition of execution integrity semantics.

The SDK layer (veip-sdk) is permissively licensed to encourage interoperability and reduce adoption friction for regulated entities and technology providers.

The Verifier Core is source-available, allowing regulators and institutions to inspect conformance logic while preventing uncontrolled commercialization that could fragment supervisory semantics.

The Registry layer governs certification issuance but does not control implementation rights. Multiple registry operators may be authorized over time, enabling federated or jurisdictional deployment models.

This separation of specification, implementation, validation, and certification ensures:

• Open implementation rights  
• Inspectable enforcement logic  
• Controlled certification marks  
• Reduced risk of standard fragmentation  
• Clear supervisory escalation pathways  

VEIP does not centralize AI governance. It formalizes a deterministic execution control-plane while preserving multi-operator institutional participation.

This layered architecture mirrors established trust infrastructures such as TLS (open protocol + certificate authorities) and ISO standards (open text + accredited certifiers).
