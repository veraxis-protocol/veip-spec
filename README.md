# Veraxis Execution Integrity Protocol (VEIP) Specification

## Overview

The Veraxis Execution Integrity Protocol (VEIP) defines a deterministic execution-control standard for AI and automated systems.

VEIP formalizes:

- State-transition integrity
- Execution-time authorization semantics
- Supervisory verification interface (SVI)
- Deterministic evidence packaging
- Conformance validation requirements

VEIP is an open specification.

This repository contains the normative standard documents and JSON schemas that define VEIP behavior.

## Foundational Invariants

1. Execution Authorization Precedes Action.
2. All State Transitions Must Be Verifiable.
3. Evidence Must Be Deterministic and Replayable.
4. Supervisory Oversight Must Be Explicit.
5. No Hidden Execution Paths.

These invariants define VEIP compliance.

## Scope

The VEIP specification governs:

- State-transition formalism
- Authority envelope semantics
- Evidence Pack structure
- Conformance Test Suite definitions
- Versioning discipline

The specification does not govern:

- Commercial implementations
- Registry operations
- Jurisdiction-specific regulatory mandates

## Licensing
