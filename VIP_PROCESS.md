# VEIP Improvement Proposal (VIP) Process

The VEIP Improvement Proposal (VIP) process governs formal changes to the VEIP specification.

This process ensures transparency, technical rigor, and prevention of semantic fragmentation.

## 1. Purpose

VIPs provide a structured mechanism for:

- Specification clarifications
- New feature proposals
- Structural changes
- Backward compatibility updates
- Conformance test extensions

## 2. VIP Categories

VIPs are classified as:

- Informational: Clarifications or non-normative updates.
- Minor Enhancement: Backward-compatible feature additions.
- Major Revision: Structural or semantic breaking changes.
- Governance Amendment: Changes to Council or process rules.

## 3. Submission Requirements

A VIP must include:

- Proposal summary
- Motivation and problem statement
- Detailed specification change
- Backward compatibility analysis
- Security implications
- Conformance impact assessment

VIP documents shall be placed in:

/vip/VIP-XXXX-title.md

## 4. Review Process

1. Public submission.
2. 60-day open review period.
3. Technical assessment.
4. Security review.
5. Vote by Council (2/3 majority required).

Breaking changes require:

- Explicit major version increment.
- Migration guidance documentation.

## 5. Transparency

All VIP discussions, votes, and decisions shall be publicly archived.

## 6. Invariants

VIP(s) may not violate foundational VEIP invariants without supermajority approval and explicit justification.
